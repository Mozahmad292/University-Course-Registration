# STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM with RELATIONAL DATABASE MYSQL using MVC MODEL

It is a university course registration system developed in MVC design pattern. The system was mainly developed focusing and based on relational database model.  Here students can log in and register courses for upcoming semester. The database holds university courses details, studentâ€™s various types of information regarding previously registered courses in past semesters, their results and most importantly allowing students to register courses for upcoming semester. It was a group project. My role was to design the Project Model and develop the entire database system using MYSQL.
